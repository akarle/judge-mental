# The Data Directory

## Required Directory Structure

The following directory structure should be followed. With this structure, all one needs to do to run `../court/law_school.py` (the script to train judges) is to first run `./data_manip.py`. The former requires the data to be in this format.

Info on how to get the data further down.
